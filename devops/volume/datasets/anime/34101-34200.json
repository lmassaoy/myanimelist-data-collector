There he met other children who were in the same situation. \"The Land of Beast\" was the name of this place and some men were taking care of tens of children. The environment seemed not rich, but children seemed to have happy lives. The men were called \"TEN\", looking rather scary, but when speaking, they were all full of heart in spite of the blunt words. One day a nice couple visited this place and took Ken (the cutest) to their home. They seemed to have no children and promised to make him happy. Every one envied him. A gorgeous car arrived. Yet it had the face of the \"SHINDU\" which by force would take away the children. They were called \"SARAIYA\" among the children. Children ran away all at once, but Takashi couldn't make it and was caught and taken into the car. The other children and \"TEN\" prayed, saying \"This can't be helped.\" The car went through a big gate and arrived at the place called \"JAIL\". He asked the \"MIHARI\" who would patrol, why he should be treated like this, and a cold answer came back. \"You will be executed in three days.\" Three days later, judged by the guards, Takashi was executed. The fact is that in the pet world this happens as a matter of fact, while this is a forcible and absurd procedure in man\u2019s world. The story was replaced in the Buddha's world.

Elder Tama asks for Kokoro's help in helping humans realize the value of their items instead of so easily tossing them away. But Tepple had snuck into the Cocotama world with the others and taken a key acorn which unlocks the Happy Tree that contains Happy Stars, the source of magic for their world. Elder Tama found out it was missing and the Cocotama gang try to track it down. He says that mushrooms are appearing on tossed away items that as they are born from the feelings of sadness, and they emit a negative energy that effects both humans and Cocotama. Cocotama can get rid of them but not without the acorn and not at the speed humans are currently discarding items at. Tepple uses the acorn to take a Happy Star but inadvertently causes a rift of darkness and an infestation of mushrooms in Cocotama World. And Happy Stars begin spilling out into the human world draining all magic out. Kokoro and the Cocotama must heal Tepple's heart before the darkness consumes the human world.", "background": "The film screened alongside Tamagotchi Movie: Tanpen Himitsu no Otodoke Daisakusen! short.", "details": {"Japanese": "\u6620\u753b \u304b\u307f\u3055\u307e\u307f\u306a\u3089\u3044 \u30d2\u30df\u30c4\u306e\u3053\u3053\u305f\u307e \u5947\u8de1\u3092\u304a\u3053\u305b\u266a\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u3068\u30c9\u30ad\u30c9\u30ad\u3053\u3053\u305f\u307e\u754c", "Type": "Movie", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Apr 28, 2017", "Producers": ["Lantis", "Bandai"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["OLM"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Kids", "Magic", "Fantasy"], "Duration": "1 hr. 16 min.", "Rating": "PG - Children", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#14834", "Popularity": "#12706", "Members": "394", "Favorites": "1"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 16:55:00"}]
