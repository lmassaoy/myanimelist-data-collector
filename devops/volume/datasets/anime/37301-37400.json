Their routine struggle to survive is interrupted by the arrival of Wakaba, a boy with no memory beyond his own name.  The girls and their new companion commit to a perilous journey across seas of burning red fog\u2014all in order to find what they need to sustain themselves on the more distant, dangerous islands swarming with robotic bugs. Their ultimate fate will be decided by their own strength, along with Wakaba's curious ability to understand the Kemurikusa: mysterious glowing leaves with wondrous powers. Besides the girls, Wakaba, and the hordes of ravenous bugs, the Kemurikusa are the last sparks of life surviving in this land. How did things end up this way? Why are there so many empty buildings with no one to live in them? Wakaba and the girls lack the answers to these questions, which means the truth can only be found within the Kemurikusa.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Japanese": "\u30b1\u30e0\u30ea\u30af\u30b5", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "12", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jan 9, 2019 to Mar 27, 2019", "Premiered": "Winter 2019", "Broadcast": "Wednesdays at 22:30 (JST)", "Producers": ["flying DOG", "Tokyo MX"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["Yaoyorozu"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Fantasy", "Sci-Fi"], "Duration": "23 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "7.07", "ScoredBy": "6839", "Ranked": "#3359", "Popularity": "#3371", "Members": "23,472", "Favorites": "112"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 18:29:35"}, {"id": 37303, "title": "K: Seven Stories Movie 2 - Side:Blue - Tenrou no Gotoku", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1640/90999.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37303/K__Seven_Stories_Movie_2_-_Side_Blue_-_Tenrou_no_Gotoku/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37303/K__Seven_Stories_Movie_2_-_Side_Blue_-_Tenrou_no_Gotoku/characters"}, "synopsis": "Gouki Zenjo, former right-hand man to Jin Habari and a survivor of the Kagutsu Incident, returns to work for SCEPTER 4, now under the command of Reisi Munakata, the new Blue King.
