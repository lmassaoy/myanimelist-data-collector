Curious, Rikka talks to her friends about the case, who agree that Yuuta is hiding something from her. They decide to discover the contents of the flash drive by any means necessary, but to their surprise, it merely contained pictures of an idol that Yuuta adored back in middle school. However, Rikka takes offense, as she claims that this breaks their contract as lovers and demands Yuuta to return the flash drive. Although having seen Yuuta return the flash drive, she still felt uncertain about the situation. This leads to her sneaking into Yuuta's room during the night, only to find out that the flash drive had not been returned! Scanning through its contents, she hurriedly rushes to bed when Yuuta enters her room. To her terror, she finds the flash drive crushed due to her negligence in keeping it in a safe place. Yuuta quickly finds out and demands an apology. However, Rikka too, demands an apology from him, resulting in both of them refusing to be the one to apologize first.

A cruise ship carrying a high school class was wrecked at sea with some of the survivors miraculously winding up on a nearby island. Though the buildings there suggest it was once populated, the only occupants now are the girls who survived the shipwreck, and the one male student that they all looked down upon for his unattractive appearance. Not long after arriving however, the girls begin to become overwhelmed with an abnormal sexual desire. No matter what they do to themselves, the lust won\u2019t go away. They discover that the cause of this is a virus, with the only cure for it being male sperm. Unfortunately, the cure is only temporary and if the lust continues uncontrolled, it results in the host of the virus dying from cardiac arrest. Now there is quite literally only one man who can save them all\u2014the very same man that they shunned before being stuck on the island. The question of Jutaijima is not whether he will or won\u2019t save them, but what sexual measures he will go to in order to do so?", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Japanese": "\u53d7\u80ce\u5cf6", "Type": "OVA", "Episodes": "2", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Dec 19, 2014 to Jan 23, 2015", "Producers": ["T-Rex"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Visual novel", "Genres": ["Hentai"], "Duration": "15 min. per ep.", "Rating": "Rx - Hentai", "Score": "6.74", "ScoredBy": "2808", "Ranked": "N/A", "Popularity": "#5669", "Members": "7,009", "Favorites": "31"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 18:02:19"}, {"id": 27613, "title": "Selector Infected WIXOSS: Midoriko-san to Piruruku-tan", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67027.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27613/Selector_Infected_WIXOSS__Midoriko-san_to_Piruruku-tan/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27613/Selector_Infected_WIXOSS__Midoriko-san_to_Piruruku-tan/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27613/Selector_Infected_WIXOSS__Midoriko-san_to_Piruruku-tan/characters"}, "synopsis": "Specials included in the Blu-ray/DVD volumes of Selector Infected WIXOSS.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Japanese": "selector infected WIXOSS \u300e\u7dd1\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u3068\u30d4\u30eb\u30eb\u30af\u305f\u3093\u300f", "Type": "Special", "Episodes": "3", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Aug 27, 2014 to Dec 19, 2014", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["J.C.Staff"], "Source": "Card game", "Genres": ["Comedy"], "Duration": "5 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "5.89", "ScoredBy": "2895", "Ranked": "#8537", "Popularity": "#5248", "Members": "8,437", "Favorites": "3"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 18:02:29"}, {"id": 27619, "title": "Ane Log: Moyako Neesan no Honpen wo Tobidashite Tomaranai Monologue", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/67235.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27619/Ane_Log__Moyako_Neesan_no_Honpen_wo_Tobidashite_Tomaranai_Monologue/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27619/Ane_Log__Moyako_Neesan_no_Honpen_wo_Tobidashite_Tomaranai_Monologue/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27619/Ane_Log__Moyako_Neesan_no_Honpen_wo_Tobidashite_Tomaranai_Monologue/characters"}, "synopsis": "Short flash episodes included on the Ane Log Fan Disc.
