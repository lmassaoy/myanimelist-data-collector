Four small beans from different places-Huangdou Card Card, Red Dou Lili, Mung Dou Xiao Cong, Hei Dou Heiqiang were sent to Doudou City by their parents to study and live. The four little beans all have distinct personalities and are different. For example, Huang Dou is a brave little guy, but he is also easily impulsive, and is a typical daredevil. Red beans are kind and cute, but sometimes too squeamish. Mung Bean is smart and easy to learn, a little inventor, but too timid. Heidou is simple and honest, a little clumsy, and poor in understanding. The four little beans met and became good friends on the way to Doudou City. At the same time, they also met a hungry iron beetle with headshots and two men on the road-the sleepworm Dumb and the follower Pizi. The three insects were planning to go to Doudou City to catch the beans, and they happened to ran into four little beans who were not deeply involved in the world. The bug deceives Xiaodouzi into claiming to be Douzi's good friend, and prepares to introduce Xiaodouzi into the trap and catch him. On the other hand, Teacher Landou from Doudou City came to meet the four little beans on the order of the mayor. Teacher Landou rescued those who fell into the bug trap.
