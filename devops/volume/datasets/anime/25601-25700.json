Grandpa tells him that just once a year, on November 20, a single brave child sees a light in the tree, but Mameta is still too scared and goes to sleep. But that very night, Grandpa suffers from intense stomach pain, and Mameta, forgetting his fears, races barefoot down the mountain to summon the doctor. On the way back up the mountain, the doctor carries him piggyback, and from his perch on the doctor's back, Mameta sees a light in the tree.  Even so, the next night and the night after, he continues to ask Grandpa to go with him to the outhouse. The moral of the story is summarized in Grandpa's words to Mameta: \"You should never think of yourself as weak or timid. So long as you have caring in your heart, you'll find that you'll be able to do what needs doing.\" (Source: booksfromjapan.jp)", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "The Tree of Courage", "Synonyms": "Mochimochi no Ki", "Japanese": "\u30e2\u30c1\u30e2\u30c1\u306e\u6728", "Type": "OVA", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jun 21, 1992", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Other", "Genres": ["Kids", "Drama"], "Duration": "20 min.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#15617", "Popularity": "#16027", "Members": "136", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 16:59:58"}, {"id": 25607, "title": "Sekai no Fushigi Tanken Series", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/65129.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25607/Sekai_no_Fushigi_Tanken_Series/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25607/Sekai_no_Fushigi_Tanken_Series/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25607/Sekai_no_Fushigi_Tanken_Series/characters"}, "synopsis": "Documentaries combining anime with live action, exploring a mixed bag of mysteries and historical topics, including the statues of Easter Island, the search for a lost continent, the Bermuda Triangle, the NAZCA Lines, the Sphinx and the Pyramids, the Greenwich Meridian, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the Great Buddha of Nara.
