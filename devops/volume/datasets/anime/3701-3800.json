It is possible for memories to be viewed, altered, and transferred between bodies. These memory chips are used by the rich to obtain eternal lives in carefully selected bodies, while for the poor, selling their own bodies and conserving their souls in the chips often become the only way to earn a living. An electrolytic cloud in the sky serves as a barrier between the heavens of the fortunate and the underworld of the destitute, making this social division impregnable.  One day, a man named Kaiba wakes up in an empty room with no memories, a mysterious hole in his chest, and a locket holding the picture of an unknown woman. After escaping an attack and stumbling upon a decrepit village of underworld residents, he begins his adventure across the different planets of this strange universe to find out more about his own identity and the woman he once knew. Through a journey of self-discovery and acceptance, Kaiba weaves together tales of souls and spirits and explores the importance of memories.", "background": "The series received an Excellence Prize for animation at the 2008 Japan Media Arts Festival.", "details": {"English": "Kaiba", "Japanese": "\u30ab\u30a4\u30d0", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "12", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Apr 11, 2008 to Jul 25, 2008", "Premiered": "Spring 2008", "Broadcast": "Unknown", "Producers": ["VAP", "WOWOW"], "Licensors": ["Discotek Media"], "Studios": ["Madhouse"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Adventure", "Mystery", "Romance", "Sci-Fi"], "Duration": "24 min. per ep.", "Rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "Score": "8.17", "ScoredBy": "33196", "Ranked": "#338", "Popularity": "#1269", "Members": "113,687", "Favorites": "2,961"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 16:21:04"}, {"id": 3702, "title": "Detroit Metal City", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/9853.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3702/Detroit_Metal_City/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3702/Detroit_Metal_City/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3702/Detroit_Metal_City/characters"}, "synopsis": "Dominating the world of indie music, Detroit Metal City (DMC) is a popular death metal band known for its captivatingly dark and crude style.

The only other name among the staff that rings a bell, though, is Yukihide Takekawa, who was responsible for the music in the magnificent and unknown Unico pilot film.  The story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess, and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s, when Toei had the best animators around, had become a thing of the past long before this point; but this is still an above-average film, in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original.
