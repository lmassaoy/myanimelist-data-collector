However, after getting forcefully dragged into a dangerous Rhyme match and hearing rumors about disappearing Rib players, all of Aoba's hopes of living a normal life are completely abolished.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "DRAMAtical Murder", "Synonyms": "DMMd", "Japanese": "\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb \u30de\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "12", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jul 7, 2014 to Sep 22, 2014", "Premiered": "Summer 2014", "Broadcast": "Unknown", "Producers": ["Avex Entertainment", "Nitroplus", "DIVE II Entertainment"], "Licensors": ["Sentai Filmworks"], "Studios": ["NAZ"], "Source": "Visual novel", "Genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi", "Super Power", "Psychological"], "Duration": "24 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "6.09", "ScoredBy": "56124", "Ranked": "#7854", "Popularity": "#1073", "Members": "137,745", "Favorites": "690"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 16:16:12"}, {"id": 23341, "title": "Yoku Wakaru Mahouka!", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/60355.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23341/Yoku_Wakaru_Mahouka/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23341/Yoku_Wakaru_Mahouka/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23341/Yoku_Wakaru_Mahouka/characters"}, "synopsis": "Special introduction videos posted on the official website.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "The irregular at magic high school: Get to Know Magic Studies!", "Synonyms": "Mahouka for Dummies", "Japanese": "\u3088\u304f\u308f\u304b\u308b\u9b54\u6cd5\u79d1\uff01", "Type": "ONA", "Episodes": "6", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Feb 22, 2014 to Sep 13, 2014", "Producers": ["Madhouse", "Aniplex"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Light novel", "Genres": ["Comedy", "Magic"], "Duration": "3 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "6.32", "ScoredBy": "9966", "Ranked": "#6792", "Popularity": "#3363", "Members": "23,583", "Favorites": "22"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 16:16:20"}, {"id": 23343, "title": "Futari no Oujisama", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/60321.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23343/Futari_no_Oujisama/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23343/Futari_no_Oujisama/characters"}, "synopsis": "On the island of Jambe, Subarna, an introverted boy, is given a magic crown and, with the help of the crown, soon becomes the people's hero known kind heartedness.
