As she adjusts to her new reality, Arisa comes to find a whole host of peculiar creatures, such as the affectionate Cheshire Cat and the lazy dormouse Round. But there is more to Wonderland than meets the eye. Each of the wild personalities she now shares a home with resembles someone she knew in her other life, yet not a single one of them recognizes their old name or relationships.
