Even after \"the Axis Shock,\" which seemed to indicate the future of humanity and the Universal Century, the world is still in a chaotic situation where intermittent military conflicts continue to break out. The Earth Federation government is more corrupt than ever, and its leadership has not only accelerated Earth's pollution, but also implemented an inhuman \"Man Hunting\" policy in which civilians are forcibly exiled to outer space. The anti-Federation government organization \"Mafty,\" led by someone called \"Mafty Navue Erin,\" has taken a stand against the corruption of the Earth Sphere. Mafty carries out fierce acts of terrorism, assassinating high officials of the Federation government one after another, but it gains a certain level of support from the populace who are growing more opposed to the Federation government. The person who calls himself \"Mafty\" and leads this organization is Hathaway Noa, the son of Bright Noa, an officer of the Earth Federation Forces who once participated in the One Year War.

She patiently waits for the wings of love to sprout and send her heart aflutter on the day that she finally receives a confession. Yet, when her classmate from junior high declares his love for her during their graduation, she feels unexpectedly hollow. The realization hits her: she understands romance as a concept, but she is incapable of experiencing the feeling first-hand. Now, having enrolled in high school, Yuu, disconcerted and dispirited, is still ruminating over how to respond to her suitor. There, she happens upon the seemingly flawless student council president, Touko Nanami, maturely rejecting a confession of her own. Stirred by Touko's elegant manner, Yuu approaches her for advice, only to be bewildered when the president confesses to her! Yuu quickly finds herself in the palm of Touko's hand, and unknowingly sets herself on a path to find the emotion which has long eluded her.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "Bloom Into You", "Synonyms": "YagaKimi, Eventually, I Will Become You", "Japanese": "\u3084\u304c\u3066\u541b\u306b\u306a\u308b", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "13", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Oct 5, 2018 to Dec 28, 2018", "Premiered": "Fall 2018", "Broadcast": "Fridays at 21:30 (JST)", "Producers": ["AT-X", "Sony Music Communications", "Docomo Anime Store", "Kadokawa Media House", "Kadokawa"], "Licensors": ["Sentai Filmworks"], "Studios": ["TROYCA"], "Source": "Manga", "Genres": ["Romance", "School", "Shoujo Ai"], "Duration": "24 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "7.92", "ScoredBy": "76807", "Ranked": "#656", "Popularity": "#763", "Members": "194,802", "Favorites": "3,661"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 18:38:46"}, {"id": 37787, "title": "Space Bug", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1063/94832.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37787/Space_Bug/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37787/Space_Bug/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37787/Space_Bug/characters"}, "synopsis": "This story is about Mick, a sleeping chironomid.
