Peacock fairies who were willing to accept disciples wanted them to dress up and come back at night. The beautiful one will be her apprentice. While the blue cardinals and red peacocks were carefully dressed up, the kind little peacock almost plucked out his feathers because of helping other small animals, and because he helped the little rabbit find herbs for curing diseases, it also failed to appear on time.

The little eggshell was unwilling to be \"trash\" and shook his sleeping brothers and sisters to wake up. They all persuaded him to give up, because The eggshell has no arms or legs. When Little Eggshell was dreaming about it, Granny Wuyun offered to help it. \u3000\u3000 On the way, a small eggshell was mistaken for an egg by a big mouse. When he saw that it was a \"waste\" eggshell, the mouse, who felt he had been played around, decided to take it home as a rice bucket. It rained heavily, and the eggshell became the mouse's eyes, and later it became a boat for the mouse to cross the river. It was at this time that it got rid of the mouse by wit, and the mouse fell into the rapids. After the rain, the eggshell was picked up by the children and painted as a nice toy. While playing happily with other toys, it met the mouse again, and it turned out that it was not drowned.
