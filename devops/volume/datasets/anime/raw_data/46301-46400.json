Legend has it that a long time ago, the Virus Demon once attacked the North Star, but Mr. Crack quickly attacked and defeated the Virus Demon. For unknown reasons, Mr. Crack did not eliminate the virus demon at the time, and then adopted a bear cub. The virus demon disappeared. Crackstar is a companion star orbiting North Star. Mr. Crack is the leader of Crack. Teacher Yan is Mr. Crack's assistant. Crack Bear is the adopted son of Mr. Crack. Crackle has a protective shield (called \"light shield\"), and the light energy comes from Polaris (more than 2000 times brighter than the sun). Suddenly one day, a large-scale virus appeared on the far earth. Crack Bear hopes that Mr. Crack will send him to solve it, but Mr. Crack and Teacher Ying have concerns. While Mr. Crack and Teacher Yan were not paying attention, Xiao Xiong carried the Crack 2 spacecraft to the earth secretly. However, the earth's virus outbreak is a conspiracy of the devil. This is his strategy of turning the tiger away from the mountain. I wanted to open Mr. Crack, but he didn't expect Crack Bear to drive the spacecraft away from Crack. This is in the arms of the virus devil. As soon as the bear bear spacecraft left Quick Buster, a large number of viruses began to besieged Quick Buster, and dark viruses were dispatched to intercept the light source of Polaris (such as the \"total solar eclipse\"), so that Quick Buster lost the protection of the light shield. Mr. Crack had to release his own energy to activate the \"Light Shield\" to protect the Quick Buster, which also prevented Mr. Crack from leaving easily. As soon as the little bear arrived on Earth, he was attacked by a powerful virus variant-a virus monster. In the midst of a panic, Mr. Crack told Little Bear that this was a conspiracy of the Virus Devil, but he was also prepared. There is a mysterious box on the crack 2 spacecraft, which contains three magic pills, each with three different abilities. Get the magic pill to gain the superhuman power to defeat the virus monster. However, these three pills were accidentally eaten by three teenagers who were hit by mistake... As a result, Crack Bear and the three children started a defense war against the virus monsters. This is a war to defend life, health and homeland ecological civilization...
