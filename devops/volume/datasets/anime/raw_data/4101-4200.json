However, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation Sara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "Private Psycho Lesson", "Japanese": "\u500b\u4eba\u6388\u696d", "Type": "OVA", "Episodes": "2", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Sep 27, 1996 to Nov 1, 1996", "Producers": ["GAGA"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["J.C.Staff"], "Source": "Unknown", "Genres": ["Comedy", "Hentai", "Yuri"], "Duration": "30 min. per ep.", "Rating": "Rx - Hentai", "Score": "5.40", "ScoredBy": "406", "Ranked": "N/A", "Popularity": "#9322", "Members": "1,655", "Favorites": "2"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 16:29:19"}, {"id": 4162, "title": "Taiho Shichau zo: Nagisa no Koutsuu Yuudou", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/21617.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4162/Taiho_Shichau_zo__Nagisa_no_Koutsuu_Yuudou/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4162/Taiho_Shichau_zo__Nagisa_no_Koutsuu_Yuudou/characters"}, "synopsis": "Summer arrives to Bokuto Station.
