Based on the manga by Noriko Umeda, this anime may be compared to the other girl-playing baseball story \"Song of the Baseball Enthusiasts\".  The Dragons team members are all based on the real-life team, though their opponents are  fictional. At the time, the real-life Hoshiyama was a commentator, but fact was eventually true to fiction and he became the manager for the real-life Dragons.
