The city of San-Teresa became a home for over two million of these otherworldly visitors. Unfortunately, the population boom also brought its fair share of problems\u2014drugs, prostitution, and trafficking. To combat the rampant crime lurking in the city's shadows, a new department was established in the San-Teresa Metropolitan Police. Former JSDF soldier Kei Matoba is one of the best cops that the department has to offer, despite his inclination to occasionally bend the rules. After a fairy trafficking case goes wrong, Kei loses Rick Fury, his friend and partner of four years, setting him on a quest for vengeance. To help him with the case, the department pairs him with Tilarna Exedilika, a noble of the Farbani Kingdom. As one of the Knights of Mirvor, her duty is to rescue the noble fairy that Kei encountered during his last case. Despite his distaste for non-humans, he accepts the arrangement at the request of his superiors. Now, the unlikely duo must come together and overcome their differences in order to return the missing fairy to her country and avenge the death of Kei's partner.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Japanese": "COP CRAFT [\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8]", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "12", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jul 9, 2019 to Oct 1, 2019", "Premiered": "Summer 2019", "Broadcast": "Tuesdays at 00:00 (JST)", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["Funimation"], "Studios": ["Millepensee"], "Source": "Light novel", "Genres": ["Action", "Fantasy", "Magic", "Police", "Sci-Fi"], "Duration": "23 min. per ep.", "Rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "Score": "6.74", "ScoredBy": "37050", "Ranked": "#4707", "Popularity": "#1503", "Members": "91,976", "Favorites": "176"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 19:02:13"}, {"id": 38954, "title": "Okoshiyasu, Chitose-chan Recaps", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1802/98078.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38954/Okoshiyasu_Chitose-chan_Recaps/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38954/Okoshiyasu_Chitose-chan_Recaps/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38954/Okoshiyasu_Chitose-chan_Recaps/characters"}, "synopsis": "Recap of the first 12 episodes of Okoshiyasu, Chitose-chan.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Synonyms": "Okoshiyasu, Chitose-chan Recap, Okoshiyasu, Chitose-chan Episode 18.5, Okoshiyasu, Chitose-chan Episode 12.5, Okoshiyasu, Chitose-chan: Hajimemashite, Chitose-chan", "Japanese": "\u304a\u3053\u3057\u3084\u3059, \u3061\u3068\u305b\u3061\u3083\u3093", "Type": "Special", "Episodes": "2", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Dec 19, 2018 to Feb 15, 2019", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["Gathering"], "Source": "Manga", "Genres": ["Slice of Life", "Comedy", "Josei"], "Duration": "3 min. per ep.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "5.80", "ScoredBy": "117", "Ranked": "#8844", "Popularity": "#12527", "Members": "424", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 19:02:28"}, {"id": 38955, "title": "Humane", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/98076.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38955/Humane/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38955/Humane/characters"}, "synopsis": "Music video for Humane by KUF from their album 'Universe'.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "HUMANE", "Japanese": "HUMANE", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Oct 21, 2018", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Dementia", "Music"], "Duration": "3 min.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#14532", "Popularity": "#15191", "Members": "184", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 19:02:30"}, {"id": 38957, "title": "Shake-chan", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1311/103101.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38957/Shake-chan/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38957/Shake-chan/characters"}, "synopsis": "Follow the crazy adventures of the young Salmon-chan (half human/half salmon) as she tries to get eaten.

With the help of a very troll system, the new Shen Qingqiu tries to stay alive by staying on Luo Binghe\u2019s good side, as the original Shen Qingqiu treated Luo Binghe badly, thus receiving a horrifying ending. However, Shen Qingqiu's plan of staying alive is not as simple as it seems as he soon finds out that the system limits his actions. This is a sometimes angsty, but also touching, story of a master and his disciple.

However, there are many aspects of our existence that science has not yet found a solution to and cannot decipher with numbers. The most notorious of these is the concept of love. While it may seem impossible to apply scientific theory to such an intricate and complex emotion, a daring pair of quick-witted Saitama University scientists aim to take on the challenge. One day the bold and beautiful Ayame Himuro outwardly declares that she is in love with Shinya Yukimura, her fellow logical and level-headed scientist. Acknowledging his own lack of experience with romance, Yukimura questions what factors constitute love in the first place and whether he is in love with Himuro or not. Both clueless in the dealings of love, the pair begin to conduct detailed experiments on one another to test the human characteristics that indicate love and discern whether they demonstrate these traits towards each other.  As Himuro and Yukimura begin their intimate analysis, can the two scientists successfully apply scientific theory, with the help of their friends, to quantify the feelings they express for one another?", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It", "Synonyms": "RikeKoi", "Japanese": "\u7406\u7cfb\u304c\u604b\u306b\u843d\u3061\u305f\u306e\u3067\u8a3c\u660e\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f\u3002", "Type": "ONA", "Episodes": "12", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jan 11, 2020", "Producers": ["Flex Comix", "Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting", "BS11", "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "Kanetsu Investment", "Toyo Recording", "ibis Capital Partners", "Y&N Brothers", "Supa Love"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["Zero-G"], "Source": "Web manga", "Genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "Duration": "23 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "7.35", "ScoredBy": "65225", "Ranked": "#2096", "Popularity": "#885", "Members": "169,906", "Favorites": "601"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 19:03:16"}, {"id": 38993, "title": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38993/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san_2/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38993/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san_2/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38993/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san_2/characters"}, "synopsis": "Even after spending a considerable amount of time with Takagi, Nishikata is still struggling to find a perfect plan to defeat the expert teaser.
