The enemy was restless, and his true identity was finally revealed. It turned out to be a mad scientist who has always been jealous of Dr. Lei's talent. In order to prove that he is smarter than Dr. Lei, he did not hesitate to develop various robots to challenge rescue soldiers. In the end, he did not hesitate to sell the earth and join forces with terrible alien invaders to destroy the earth with terrible technology.
