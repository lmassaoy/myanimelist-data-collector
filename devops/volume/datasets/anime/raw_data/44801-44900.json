The Japanese marched into the Central Plains, and the leading troops came to the must pass fortress: Maijiacun. \u3000\u3000 The Japanese army leader Noda Ichiro originally thought that Xiaomai\u2019s family village, facing the Japanese gold and iron horses, mechanized troops, should be captured with nothing, and thus fell. Unexpectedly, at the most critical moment, Mai Bao's father contacted the villagers in the neighboring villages and formed a guerrilla team to make landmines and resist tenaciously by using nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal to make gunpowder. For a time, the Japanese army repeatedly retreated, and was even more frightened of the Maijia mines. Ye Tian\u2019s cunning and cunning decided to arrest the Chinese on a large scale, threatening a few cowardly people to become traitors, and mixed into the Maijiacun guerrillas.

At this time, Noda also successfully bought the villager Cai Ding as a spy to join the guerrillas. At this point, the undercover vs. undercover situation still arises. \u3000\u3000 After Grandpa Mai waited for a group of villagers to be arrested, Father Mai decided to attack the Japanese army headquarters at night to save people. Unexpectedly, Cai Ding informed Noda of this news. The Japanese army decided to do everything possible.

When the night fell, the Maibao scene saw that his grandpa and others were passed on to the Japanese military uniforms. Mai Bao struggled inwardly. The ambush led the team to arrive. Fortunately, Mai Bao was clever, climbed up the city wall, flashed the Morse code with the searchlight flashing, and Father Mai received the information and walked away. When Noda saw the Morse code of the searchlight, he was suspicious, and Mai Bao blamed Xiao Chun on the captain's confidant, and Xiao Chun had a scapegoat. \u3000\u3000 Cai Ding broke the news again that the guerrillas found that the gunpowder was exhausted and the materials were not enough, so they decided to enter the Japanese barracks to steal gunpowder. Maibao and Sandongli should unite outside, resorting to the strategy of adjusting the tiger away from the mountain and cooperating with the guerrillas to get the gunpowder. Finally got the gunpowder, and even the Japanese landmines. However, the Japanese mine detection team was ordered to arrive. Mai Bao once again used the kite to send news, but was destroyed by Xiao Chun, and Ye Tian was suspicious of everyone and dragged Xiao. Spring, Sandong, Mai Bao, etc. play games. Mai Bao's avatar lacked skills and could not release the news. Maijiacun was at stake.

Mai Bao saw Kameda and Xiao Chun vying for favor in front of Noda and tried to divorce them, making them intolerable. The two competed for the first prize and helped detect mines. Unexpectedly, Father Mai had already received the news that he bought broken iron in the ground. Instead of detecting the mine, the two stepped on the mine and shouted for help. The Japanese army marched forward. , Was trapped by a mine array, causing numerous casualties. Noda had no choice but to summon gold to retreat and consider the long term. Noda was reluctant to fight and lose, but because of Cai Ding's reminder that he learned that there was an undercover around him, and began to distrust everyone. It's night, Noda re-entangled with his men and horses, trying to attack Maijia Village in the dark. The villagers like Grandpa and other villagers were the first to step on landmines. The grandfather and the others regarded death as home, and the righteousness Lingran, Mai Bao felt uncomfortable, but could not show it. What is more important is how to inform the father. Seeing that he was about to enter the minefield, Mai Bao suddenly came up with a masterpiece again, and his father led the guerrillas to rescue the villagers. \u3000\u3000 Noda returned to the camp, yelling, and locked his suspicions on Mai Bao, Xiao Chun, Sandong and Kameda. Noda decided to take everyone to the ultimate place for interrogation of prisoners-Wind Sound Castle. Noda resorted to various tricks in the movie \"The Sound of the Wind\" to everyone. Although they all ended in jokes, the day when Noda's \"I would rather kill the wrong, never let it go\" policy of catching undercover agents is becoming more and more tight. Sandong decided to fight for the last time and was eventually escaped by the two of them, but Sandong was shot.

To drive all Japanese devils out of China. \u3000\u3000 Mai Bao returned to Maijia Village, the first task was to find out the undercover guerrillas. The father and son Mai Bao sang the double song, and father Mai deliberately resigned from the position of guerrilla captain. He endured the humiliation and secretly found the undercover Cai Ding. At this time, Nodazai didn't have the patience to play, and finally used his killer-the tank. Noda gathered 50 tanks and drove mightily to Maijiacun, trying to razor it to the ground. The battle between landmines and tanks is about to start! \u3000\u3000 Maibao used landmines to set off bombs and blow up the first tank. The father of Mai Bao pulled the stone mine and blew up the mountain, trapping all Japanese tanks in Maijia Village immobile. The villagers threw countless fires and burned their houses. In an instant, the entire Maijia Village turned into a sea of \u200b\u200bflames. The tanks received high temperature, and some exploded naturally.
