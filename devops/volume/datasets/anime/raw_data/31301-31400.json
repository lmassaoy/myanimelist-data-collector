The indiscriminate alien attacks awoke him and he led the humans to a decisive victory. One year later, while the areas which had been destroyed by the aliens were still being rebuilt, Ryuusei was appointed as the commander of the newly-formed Defence Force of Earth, which was created to fight against space invaders. However, he was the only person who could use the \u2018imagination embodiment device\u2019. If something was to happen to him, then calamity would befall the world. So the Defence Force of Earth decided to recruit girls with potential to fight alongside him. Even though they hesitated at first, they each had their own reasons to join Ryuusei. Thus, the special force \u2018Blade Briders\u2019 was formed, to protect the Earth against the aliens who have returned.

Most people would look and see an innocent. Not one guy. One guy imagined her begging, tearful face and got aroused. He didn't even realize how deep his sadist desires went. He began to stalk her. He looked for anything to feed the fantasy that she was a dirty whore. A justification. And then, a single DVD arrived in the mail. The DVD was a secret gathering in the home of a wealthy family, where adults helped themselves to a young girl. The young girl was Sayaka. The sex was rougher than anything he'd ever seen. Several days later, the person who sent the DVD made a request. \"I know who you are. I want an amateur with your sort of perverse interests to do some training.\" A drug was provided. It was a drug used to make the gathering video. Sayaka lived for it. She existed to taste it. Her hunger for the drug made her beg and plead... The desire that marinated his sadist heart now aimed at her.
