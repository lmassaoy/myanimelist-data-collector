After hearing rumors that her best friend was tricked by the popular host of a local club, Hotaru seeks to punish the evildoer. Upon arriving at the club, however, she is challenged to a so-called \"survival game\" by the host Masamune Matsuoka, where the first person hit by the bullet of a toy gun will lose. After a destructive fight which results in Hotaru's loss, Masamune forces the young \"boy\" to join his survival game team named Toy Gun Gun, in order to repay the cost of the damages that \"he\" has caused inside the club. Although she is initially unhappy with this turn of events, Hotaru quickly begins to enjoy what survival games have to offer and is determined to pay off her debt, much to the dismay of Tooru Yukimura, the other member of Toy Gun Gun. As time goes on, Hotaru begins to develop a close friendship with the rest of the team and hopes to take part in realizing their dream of winning the Top Combat Game (TCG), a tournament to decide the best survival game team in Japan. Although Hotaru tries her best, there are just two little problems: she is absolutely terrible at the game, and Toy Gun Gun doesn't allow female members on their team!", "background": "No background information", "details": {"English": "Aoharu x Machinegun", "Synonyms": "Aoharu x Machine Gun", "Japanese": "\u9752\u6625\u00d7\u6a5f\u95a2\u9283", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "12", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jul 3, 2015 to Sep 18, 2015", "Premiered": "Summer 2015", "Broadcast": "Fridays at 01:46 (JST)", "Producers": ["TBS", "DAX Production", "chara-ani.com", "Sony Music Communications", "King Records", "NichiNare"], "Licensors": ["Sentai Filmworks"], "Studios": ["Brain's Base"], "Source": "Manga", "Genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Sports", "Shounen"], "Duration": "24 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "7.18", "ScoredBy": "84959", "Ranked": "#2833", "Popularity": "#806", "Members": "184,452", "Favorites": "1,286"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 15:21:42"}, {"id": 30206, "title": "Amagi Brilliant Park: Nonbirishiteiru Hima ga Nai!", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74772.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30206/Amagi_Brilliant_Park__Nonbirishiteiru_Hima_ga_Nai/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30206/Amagi_Brilliant_Park__Nonbirishiteiru_Hima_ga_Nai/characters"}, "synopsis": "Unaired episode bundled with the seventh Blu-ray and DVD volume of Amagi Brilliant Park.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Synonyms": "Amagi Brilliant Park Episode 14, Amagi Brilliant Park Tokubetsu-hen", "Japanese": "\u7518\u57ce\u30d6\u30ea\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30af \u300c\u306e\u3093\u3073\u308a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u6687\u304c\u306a\u3044!\u300d", "Type": "Special", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jun 26, 2015", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["Sentai Filmworks"], "Studios": ["Kyoto Animation"], "Source": "Light novel", "Genres": ["Comedy", "Magic", "Fantasy"], "Duration": "23 min.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "7.25", "ScoredBy": "41829", "Ranked": "#2564", "Popularity": "#1766", "Members": "73,711", "Favorites": "32"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 15:21:43"}, {"id": 30207, "title": "Watashi wa \"Tofu\" Desu", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/72277.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30207/Watashi_wa_Tofu_Desu/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30207/Watashi_wa_Tofu_Desu/characters"}, "synopsis": "A music video for the song by Kazuo Kumakura and NHK Tokyo Children's Choir that was featured on NHK's Minna no Uta Program.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Synonyms": "Minna no Uta, Watashi wa Tofu Desu", "Japanese": "\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u300c\u3068\u3046\u3075\u300d\u3067\u3059", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Aug 4, 1977", "Producers": ["NHK"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Music", "Kids"], "Duration": "2 min.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#12828", "Popularity": "#15631", "Members": "157", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 15:21:44"}, {"id": 30208, "title": "Shiritori Mambo", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/72278.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30208/Shiritori_Mambo/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30208/Shiritori_Mambo/characters"}, "synopsis": "A music video for the song by Kazuo Kumakura and Happy Life that was featured on NHK's Minna no Uta Program.

At the start of the first semester under this new decree, a mere five boys have been accepted, effectively splitting the student body into a ratio of two hundred girls to one boy. Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Andre, and Jo are quickly cast away without having a chance to make any kind of a first impression. Unable to communicate with their fellow female students, the eager boys set their sights on a far more dangerous task: peeping into the girls' bath! It's only after their plan is thoroughly decimated by the infamous Underground Student Council that the motley crew find their freedom abruptly taken from them, as they are thrown into the school's prison with the sentence of an entire month as punishment. Thus begins the tale of the boys' harsh lives in Prison School, a righteous struggle that will ultimately test the bonds of friendship and perverted brotherhood.", "background": "The Japanese cast has been universally praised for their work while in contrast the English dub has been heavily criticized for its casting, voice acting and writing.", "details": {"English": "Prison School", "Synonyms": "Kangoku Gakuen", "Japanese": "\u76e3\u7344\u5b66\u5712\u3008\u30d7\u30ea\u30ba\u30f3\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u3009", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "12", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Jul 11, 2015 to Sep 26, 2015", "Premiered": "Summer 2015", "Broadcast": "Saturdays at 01:05 (JST)", "Producers": ["Genco", "Kodansha", "Movic", "Warner Bros.
