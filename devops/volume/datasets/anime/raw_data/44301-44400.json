Only by getting the energy inside can she restore her shield and life, and defeat the evil Ares. . \u3000\u3000 After waking up, at the prompt of Coubertin's letter, Beibei made an oath: to travel through time and space, return to 1896, and help the goddess to obtain the wooden box. \u3000\u3000According to Athena's instructions: Beibei went down to the sea to look for the old man of Eastern time and space, \"Must He\". But in the deep sea canyon, I encountered a gluttonous little monster-Pihu. He is the nine sons of the dragon, the younger brother of Bixi. Many years ago, I fell into the sea because I wanted to eat the sun. I am currently suffering from my \"eternal hunger\" stomach problem. When I heard about the wooden box that hides huge energy, I also actively joined Beibei's travel. \u3000\u3000 Under the leadership of Pixiu, Beibei found Bixi. Bixie drove the two into the \"time-space tunnel\", but shortly after passing through the gate of the 21st century, he was caught in an ambush by Ares's Purulu. Bixie was blind in both eyes and was forced to stop traveling. \u3000\u3000 must like to ask the children to enter the nearest time and space-in 1984, look for a drop of tears from the most excited and happiest moment of mankind to clean their eyes, so that they can continue to travel and return to 1896. \u3000\u3000Pixiu and Beibei respectively found Chinese shooter Xu Haifeng and Haitian marathon athlete Lamot in 1984. After many setbacks, Beibei drew tears from Lamot. When the two returned to the time-space tunnel, they met Ares who had fought against Bixi. In the chaos, Bixi's Dragon Ruyi was taken away, and his body became weak and shrinking. \u3000\u3000 Beibei used tears to restore Bixie's eyesight, but only by retrieving Ruyi can he cross the gate of the next century and enter 1896.

With the efforts of Pixiu and Beibei, the wishful pearls were collected one by one, and finally two left to form the wishful dragon. \u3000\u3000 At this time, Ares created a trap and took the three to his dark kingdom-Skull Island. \u3000\u3000 With the help of the Fuwa brothers and sisters, Beibei woke up at a critical moment, rescued Pixiu, and escaped from Skull Island. \u3000\u3000 The two went into 1988 with the help of other Fuwa, and found the last two wishful beads, and took the opportunity to discover the secret of Skull Island-only the Olympic flame can break through the gate to Skull Island. \u3000\u3000 But the dark little demon sealed the road to the Olympic node and prevented them from obtaining the torch. \u3000\u3000 Pixiu recalled that a person he had met at the Tokyo Olympics said that he was going to steal the torch and show it to his fathers and villagers. So he took Bei Bei to the man's hometown: Kagoshima, where he got the torch that had been burning for more than 20 years. \u3000\u3000 The two used the sacred fire to break into Skull Island, rescued Bixi, and retrieved all the wishful beads. \u3000\u3000 Ruyizhu merged to form Ruyi, and Bixi was completely restored. They happily went to the gate of the 19th century, only to find that even if Ruyi, the gate could not be opened. It turned out that Ares would be happy to escape, and Ruyi was also taken back, so they forcibly blocked the Century Gate, and according to Pihu Talking about the information revealed in 1896 in Athens, Greece, looking for wooden boxes. \u3000\u3000 Under the reminder of the good friend Huoer of Bixi, they learned that the only way to open the door is to collect information on human memory. As long as you find enough five kinds of information: generosity, justice, humility, talent, and integrity (corresponding to benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, and faith), you can lift the seal and open the door to the century. \u3000\u3000 So the three again entered the Olympic Games in time and space to search. \u3000\u3000 At the 1924 Paris Olympics, he obtained Harrod's \"little message\". \u3000\u3000 Obtained Liu Changchun's \"Message of Righteousness\" at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. \u3000\u3000 At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, he obtained Owens\u2019s \"Benevolence Message\", Luz Lang\u2019s \"Righteous Message\", and fencer Helena\u2019s \"Faith Message\". \u3000\u3000 At the 1948 London Olympics, he obtained Finney's \"information of wisdom\". \u3000\u3000 I got information from Meng Guanliang, Yang Wenjun and Waldner at the 2004 Athens Olympics. In the meantime, Ares saw the situation fail step by step, and in desperation, he had to ask for help from the Gorgeous Medusa, who lives in the Sea of \u200b\u200bDeath, and asked her to take out the \"Horn of Darkness\" so that he could have the power to summon the dark monster army. . Therefore, when the three of them brought enough memory information to open the gate of the century, they were attacked by the dark monster army. The two entangled and fought into 1896. Finally, Beibei used wisdom to repel the monster and used Athena to give The olive leaf found the location of the buried wooden box. \u3000\u3000 Unexpectedly, just after dug out the wooden box, Ares snatched the wooden box again.

Bixie drove the two into the \"time-space tunnel\", but shortly after passing through the gate of the 21st century, he was caught in an ambush by Ares's Purulu. Bixie was blind in both eyes and was forced to stop traveling. \u3000\u3000 must like to ask the children to enter the nearest time and space-in 1984, look for a drop of tears from the most excited and happiest moment of mankind to clean their eyes, so that they can continue to travel and return to 1896. \u3000\u3000Pixiu and Beibei respectively found Chinese shooter Xu Haifeng and Haitian marathon athlete Lamot in 1984. After many setbacks, Beibei drew tears from Lamot. When the two returned to the time-space tunnel, they met Ares who had fought against Bixi. In the chaos, Bixi's Dragon Ruyi was taken away, and his body became weak and shrinking. \u3000\u3000 Beibei used tears to restore Bixie's eyesight, but only by retrieving Ruyi can he cross the gate of the next century and enter 1896. So Bixie took the two children and started looking for Ruyi. \u3000\u3000 They have discovered the existence of Ruyi in different Olympic years, but they have collected small Ruyi beads. It turned out that Ruyi was scattered by Ares and placed on the athlete to replicate the energy for his own use. With the efforts of Pixiu and Beibei, the wishful pearls were collected one by one, and finally two left to form the wishful dragon. \u3000\u3000 At this time, Ares created a trap and took the three to his dark kingdom-Skull Island. \u3000\u3000 With the help of the Fuwa brothers and sisters, Beibei woke up at a critical moment, rescued Pixiu, and escaped from Skull Island. \u3000\u3000 The two went into 1988 with the help of other Fuwa, and found the last two wishful beads, and took the opportunity to discover the secret of Skull Island-only the Olympic flame can break through the gate to Skull Island. \u3000\u3000 But the dark little demon sealed the road to the Olympic node and prevented them from obtaining the torch. \u3000\u3000 Pixiu recalled that a person he had met at the Tokyo Olympics said that he was going to steal the torch and show it to his fathers and villagers. So he took Bei Bei to the man's hometown: Kagoshima, where he got the torch that had been burning for more than 20 years. \u3000\u3000 The two used the sacred fire to break into Skull Island, rescued Bixi, and retrieved all the wishful beads. \u3000\u3000 Ruyizhu merged to form Ruyi, and Bixi was completely restored. They happily went to the gate of the 19th century, only to find that even if Ruyi, the gate could not be opened. It turned out that Ares would be happy to escape, and Ruyi was also taken back, so they forcibly blocked the Century Gate, and according to Pihu Talking about the information revealed in 1896 in Athens, Greece, looking for wooden boxes. \u3000\u3000 Under the reminder of the good friend Huoer of Bixi, they learned that the only way to open the door is to collect information on human memory. As long as you find enough five kinds of information: generosity, justice, humility, talent, and integrity (corresponding to benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, and faith), you can lift the seal and open the door to the century. \u3000\u3000 So the three again entered the Olympic Games in time and space to search. \u3000\u3000 At the 1924 Paris Olympics, he obtained Harrod's \"little message\". \u3000\u3000 Obtained Liu Changchun's \"Message of Righteousness\" at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. \u3000\u3000 At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, he obtained Owens\u2019s \"Benevolence Message\", Luz Lang\u2019s \"Righteous Message\", and fencer Helena\u2019s \"Faith Message\". \u3000\u3000 At the 1948 London Olympics, he obtained Finney's \"information of wisdom\". \u3000\u3000 I got information from Meng Guanliang, Yang Wenjun and Waldner at the 2004 Athens Olympics. In the meantime, Ares saw the situation fail step by step, and in desperation, he had to ask for help from the Gorgeous Medusa, who lives in the Sea of \u200b\u200bDeath, and asked her to take out the \"Horn of Darkness\" so that he could have the power to summon the dark monster army. . Therefore, when the three of them brought enough memory information to open the gate of the century, they were attacked by the dark monster army. The two entangled and fought into 1896. Finally, Beibei used wisdom to repel the monster and used Athena to give The olive leaf found the location of the buried wooden box. \u3000\u3000 Unexpectedly, just after dug out the wooden box, Ares snatched the wooden box again. Beibei, Pixiu, and Bixie tried their best to chase into Skull Island, and Bixie held the gate with his body at the gate of Skull Island and turned it into a stone sculpture. \u3000\u3000 The final battle started on Skull Island. Four other Fuwas sent by Coubertin also joined the battle. Skull Island was dark. In order to defeat Fuwa, Ares opened the wooden box. Unexpectedly, the wooden box was empty, and there was no \"great energy\" as he imagined. The only thing that fell out was one sentence-\"Call on young people from all over the world to fight on the field. Instead of fighting on the battlefield.\" \u3000\u3000 At this time, Athena was resurrected, and the cracks on the shield recovered one by one. She turned Ares into a mass of mud and melted on the ground of Skull Island. The originally gloomy Skull Island suddenly grew luxuriant flowers and plants, and the Bixi stone sculpture stood peacefully here. \u3000\u3000 Athena asked them to be wary of Ares's resurrection, and told them that Bixie was not dead. As long as the Olympics continue, he will be resurrected.

Each planet in the galaxy has colorful colors. All living organisms on this galaxy are made of metals and machines. Through the vicissitudes of life, each planet has gradually spawned brilliant civilizations. However, one day long, long time later, the catastrophe of this colorful galaxy is about to come. The cosmic predator Black Hole King, who came from afar, intends to annex this galaxy. The Black Hole King\u2019s planet is his huge spacecraft that specializes in consuming other planets to maintain energy. In the end, only the largest and most beautiful rainbow star in the galaxy survived, because the star has seven countries: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. The seven colors are mixed into a rainbow light to protect the planet. , So that the black hole king has no way to speak. However, Prince Zebra, the son of the black hole king, learned that because of the different colors, the seven countries have been fighting for a long time, year after year. As long as one of the colors is eliminated, the seven-color holy light shield will disappear, and the rainbow star will eventually become the food for the black hole spacecraft. The Zebra Prince also took the initiative to ask for help, leading his loyal black knights to sneak into the Rainbow Star to carry out an operation of separation, in an attempt to intensify the war between the seven countries, so that a certain country can be eliminated as soon as possible. Looking at the chaotic current situation of Rainbow Star, Rainbow Star Grand Elder Invincible Earl was deeply worried, and he knew that if this continues, Rainbow Star will embark on a path of self-destruction. So he tried to summon the seven kings for peace talks so that the war would end as soon as possible. Who knew that the kings didn't agree with each other, and they fought again. Not only was peace disillusioned, the Invincible Earl was also beaten into a crippled machine and fell into the mountains. However, Earl of Invincibility was fortunate to be rescued by the orphans living in the deep mountains, and was reborn. It was a pity that his body was replaced by a deer body that could only barely move, and he could not continue to complete the mission of saving the planet. But at this time, he accidentally discovered that Dingy, a different color from the Seven Kingdoms, possessed seven screws\u2014this \"little monster\" was actually the legendary savior. Dingty thus shouldered the important mission of the savior. According to Invincible Earl\u2019s preliminary idea, the first is to train Dingy to become a super soldier, suppress all forces on the planet, and become the supreme commander in order to end the war. At this time, Prince Zebra also came to the Rainbow Planet. His plan coincided with the Invincible Earl and also seized the leadership of this planet, but he was eager to further escalate the war between the Seven Kingdoms.
