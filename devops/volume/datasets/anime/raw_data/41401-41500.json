The story features a prison system, in which prisoners are sealed in personal containment systems known as \"laminated suits\" and used for labor. Prisoners go through a \"Lamination\" process, where they are fitted with cybernetic, laminated skin-tight suits. In these suits, they can move around and completed work assignments that cannot be done by machine or robots. Law-abiding citizens are protected, while the criminals become members of society in a futuristic prison system. This process ensures that convicted criminals remain productive members in a system of virtual slavery.
