One day as Hirono is walking to school, a beautiful and voluptuous girlliterally drops out of the sky and into his life.

Her domain has been conquered by the power mad despot, Rimeru and his armies of monstrous \"Seed Men.\" She barely escaped her domain with the power artifact known as the \"Dream Note.\" The \"Dream Note\" enables its possessor to create anything they desire by merely drawing or writing information within its pages. Rimeru seeks to steal it to become Master of the Universe. She demands that Hirono give her back the book, but Hirono had already begun drawing into the book (mystically linking himself to it). Hirono soon discovers that his designs and notes on Wing Man become reality and he in turn becomes his own creation. Using these powers and abilities, he and Aoi begin their strange and amazing adventure. Along the way, Hirono inadvertently involves all of his friends, especially Miku in his quest to help Aoi free her people and save her father.
