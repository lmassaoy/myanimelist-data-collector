The summer vacation is about to pass, and the annual admissions exam for Beijing Tibet Middle School will be held soon. For Tibetan children living in the grasslands of Tibetan areas and yearning for the outside world, the exam in early August is undoubtedly the most important exam in their lives. Like all children who dream of going to Beijing to go to school, Yang Jin's wish is to be admitted to Beijing Tibet Middle School, then to Nationalities University, and return to Tibet in the future to contribute to the construction of Tibetan areas. \u3000\u3000 However, this young eagle on the grassland encountered wind and rain during its first test flight. The drunk Abba did not agree with Yang Jin to leave the grassland. Abba's opposition poured cold water on Yang Jin. If it weren't for the \"Talking on behalf\" program of the radio station on the grasslands of Tibet, Yang Jin's dream would have been shattered. The radio's \"On behalf of the dialect\" program is the main way for people in the pastoral areas on the plateau to communicate. For many years, people in Tibetan areas have learned about the outside world through this program. Therefore, Lahm, the female announcer who hosted the \"On behalf of the Dialogue\" program, became the goddess in the minds of Tibetan children. \u3000\u3000 In order to help Yang Jin realize his dream, Tashi and Genga tried every means to ask Ram to persuade Yang Jin's Abba in the show. Not only that, the old Akha from Tashi Temple also made a special trip to Yangjin's house to do the work of Yangjin Abba. Under the persuasion of the big guy, Yang Jin's father finally agreed to take Yang Jin to take the exam. On the day of the exam, Yang Jin was surrounded by the stars and the moon among the students who came to answer the questions. Seeing this scene, Abba is also proud of her daughter's achievement. \u3000\u3000 Yang Jin\u2019s Abba opposed Yang Jin\u2019s attitude of leaving the grassland to go to Beijing to go to school, and came a 180-degree turn, but it does not mean that Yang Jin will be able to realize her dream smoothly. In order to make up for the cost of going to school in Beijing, Yang Jin tried his best. But when Yang Jin found out that the hundreds of plastic bottles he had collected were not worth a lot of money, and begged others to hire her to herd sheep and was rejected because of her young age, Yang Jin was discouraged. Perhaps it was Yang Jin's perseverance that moved the Buddha, or it was Yang Jin's knowledge that helped her. The precious yellow mushrooms growing on the grassland gave Yang Jin a glimmer of hope. \u3000\u3000 But good things are hard to come by. When the money to go to school just got a little bit off, Lahm did not have Yang Jin's name in the list of admissions announced in the \"Talking on behalf\" program. All efforts are going to vanish. At this time, with the persistence of Genga, Ram and others, it was finally discovered that the list was wrong. Yang Jin lived up to the expectations and was admitted to Beijing Tibet Middle School as the champion. Yang Jin is about to leave for Beijing to realize his dream, that is, in the twists and turns of Yang Jin's schooling, Ram, who is \"on behalf of the spokesman\", finally unveiled her mysterious veil in front of Tashi and Genga.(translated from douban)", "background": "This anime aired in 2006.", "details": {"English": "Songs from the Mongolian Grassland", "Japanese": "\u5929\u7c41", "Type": "Movie", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Not available", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Adventure", "Kids"], "Duration": "1 hr. 30 min.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#0", "Popularity": "#0", "Members": "0", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 23:04:33"}, {"id": 44695, "title": "Taiyang Shizhe", "photo": null, "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/44695/Taiyang_Shizhe/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/44695/Taiyang_Shizhe/characters"}, "synopsis": "In ancient times, in the \"five hundred years of the Great Desolation\", there was a beautiful and rich tribe-Wuyang City, which was originally prosperous, harmonious and peaceful, but the ruler breeds evil thoughts and started a war between tribes to fight for power.
