The child came to the kitchen to steal food, but was caught by his father, who used traditional etiquette and good manners.

A bowl of \"Lunar New Year Soup\" for hospitality, blending simplicity and tenderness, conveys the flavor of the Spring Festival in ancient times. \u3000\u3000 \"Lovesickness\" tells the story of Tong'er (full name Wang Chutong), a young man with long braids in the Qing Dynasty, and Liu Niang, a childhood sweetheart, and a love affair with red beans when they were young. After growing up, the boy and Liu Niang had no choice but to pass by because of improper households. Later, Liu Niang was forced to marry the rich young master, and was no longer able to stay with the young man in her heart. The boy who lost his love waited for his fame and left his hometown on a small boat with a handkerchief embroidered by Liuniang with a red bean pattern. \u3000\u3000 \"Wandering Zi Yin\" is based on the story of Wang Mingsheng, a Qing historian and classicist, presents a universal story of motherhood for thousands of years.
