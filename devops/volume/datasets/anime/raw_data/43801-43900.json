When it sees the younger brothers and sisters, it has a whim, trying to get the secret recipe from them, so that it can learn from Monkey King and get into the belly of Princess Iron Fan. The method here achieves the goal of dominating mankind. In order to obtain the secret recipe of the supergene miniature agent, the rat demon resorted to all conspiracy and insidious means to launch a full-scale attack on the brother and sister. The rat demon instructs the bat spirit and the poisonous hedgehog to deceive the brother and sister into the \"weird city\". There are many small cities in the \"Strange City\", and they are all dwarves. There are many weird things in \"Strange City\". The brothers and sisters have withstood all the tests in the \"weird city\", fought against the rat monsters, did not reveal the top secret of the supergene miniatures, and avoided the catastrophe of mankind. The villain headed by the rat demon was finally punished due to it. The whole film is exaggerated and absurd, with profound meaning, climaxing, and rich in imagination. It is a childlike film.
