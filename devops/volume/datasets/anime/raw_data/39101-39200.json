They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird. This particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, \"Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it\u2019s only a drop, you can't put out this fire.\" And as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird\u2019s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, \"What do you think you are doing?\" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, \"I am doing what I can.\" (Source: sechangersoi.be)", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Synonyms": "The Story of the Hummingbird", "Japanese": "\u30cf\u30c1\u30c9\u30ea\u306e\u3072\u3068\u3057\u305a\u304f \u79c1\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068", "Type": "OVA", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Not available", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Other", "Genres": ["Kids"], "Duration": "19 min.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#14217", "Popularity": "#17329", "Members": "55", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 19:18:11"}, {"id": 39148, "title": "Mottainai", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1415/98615.jpg", "links": {"stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39148/Mottainai/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39148/Mottainai/characters"}, "synopsis": "An educational anime about environmental waste aimed at promoting recycling to children.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Japanese": "MOTTAINAI \u3082\u3063\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3044", "Type": "OVA", "Episodes": "1", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Not available", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Kids"], "Duration": "22 min.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#15670", "Popularity": "#17255", "Members": "61", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 19:18:12"}, {"id": 39149, "title": "Ushiwakamaru", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/98644.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39149/Ushiwakamaru/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39149/Ushiwakamaru/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39149/Ushiwakamaru/characters"}, "synopsis": "A time-slipped Ushiwakamaru (the childhood name of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, a military commander of the Minamoto clan and is known as one of the strongest samurai in the history of Japan) arrives in modern day Japan and has to learn traffic safety, bicycle traffic safety, disaster prevention, and kidnapping prevention.", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Japanese": "\u3046\u3057\u308f\u304b\u307e\u308b", "Type": "OVA", "Episodes": "4", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Not available", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Original", "Genres": ["Historical", "Kids"], "Duration": "12 min. per ep.", "Rating": "G - All Ages", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#12741", "Popularity": "#17312", "Members": "56", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 19:18:13"}, {"id": 39150, "title": "Otogi", "photo": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/98672.jpg", "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39150/Otogi/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39150/Otogi/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39150/Otogi/characters"}, "synopsis": "Eve's first press limited edition release of their Otogi album CD includes an accompanying DVD.
