The fried chicken shop opened by father Chen Weilin has been steadily rising since it was named \"Bombing Chicken\". They moved out of their old house and bought a new house in the suburbs. Xiao Di also has her own bedroom, so she doesn't need to live in the same room with her sister. Dad also bought a QQ car for transportation. This QQ car has the dual functions of a passenger car and a truck. \u3000\u3000The new home is far away from the city, and Da Di has to squeeze the subway to go to work every day during peak hours. To work in the company, Da Di must act like a desperate Saburo in order not to be fired. Fortunately, she met Ma Linshu who was an actress in a puppet theater. The two fell in love at first sight, but Da Di was too busy to date. \u3000\u3000 Ma Linshu, as a small actor who is similar to a freelancer, always has a lot of free time. He happily comes to Daddy for a date every time, but any phone call from Daddy\u2019s boss, client or even colleague will make the appointment ruin. After finally getting through the weekend, Ma Linshu felt that he finally had time! But for Da Di on weekends, it is a rare time to make up for sleep! \u3000\u3000 Mom\u2019s biggest interest was playing mahjong and perming her hair. But since Ma Linshu appeared, her mother has found a new joy in life-beating a mandarin duck. My mother said to Da Di: Ma Linshu is a person who spends half of his life suffering from gains and losses, and half of his life. \u3000\u3000 The love path of this little couple has just begun, and it is already in danger. \u3000\u3000 Xiaodi went to junior high school and still had poor grades. She is always confused and lazy. She often forgets to do her homework on time, but can always remember the number of snacks at home. \u3000\u3000Daddy is still busy \"bombing chicken\", busy writing his poems, and worrying that no one appreciates it. \u3000\u3000 Everyone in the family seems to be extremely busy, but grandma too often stays at home alone, very lonely. She hoped that they could spend more time with her, but she felt sorry for them and didn't want to take up their few rest time. \u3000\u3000 Grandma Tai wrote to her sister Furong in order to eliminate loneliness. She did not find a suitable letterhead, so she wrote on the back of an old calendar. The front of the calendar is a photo of \"Shenzhou VII\". \u3000\u3000Furong\u2019s great-grandson Haohao is pestering her to ask where her parents are? It turned out that Haohao's parents divorced and fostered him at the grandmother's house. Grandma Tai is unwilling to hurt Haohao, and every day she makes up a beautiful lie to deal with Haohao. Just when she was racking her brains, the doorbell rang, and she opened the door and saw the postman standing outside, with a letter for her to sign. Grandma Haohaotai said: This is a letter from your father. Haohao looked forward to seeing Grandma Tai open the envelope. He saw the picture of \"Shenzhou VII\" and said: Wow! Does my father live in such an impressive house? \u3000\u3000 Haohao kept this matter in his mind and asked his grandma a lot about outer space. It didn't take long for him to start looking for his father. Haohao asked Grandma Tai, is the address on the envelope where Dad lives? Grandma too said yes. Haohao didn't tell her grandma to put on his pet-a cat that looked like a pig, and got on the train to find his father. \u3000\u3000 A few days later, he knocked on the door of the Chen family. Too grandma opened the door, but Xiao Di was stunned, because Haohao's first sentence was: Is this the landing module of \"Shenzhou Seven\"? The Chen family was in a mess with a strange child who was full of spaceships in outer space. Grandma too learned of the situation from Furong, so the whole family held a meeting to study the matter. Grandma Tai insisted on keeping Haohao, but her family members opposed it. But when they learned that Haohao's parents had divorced, they decided to keep him. In this way, Haohao began his life in the Chen family. \u3000\u3000 A few days after Haohao moved in, his mother took Haohao to the school. But because Haohao was too eccentric, he was always dropped out of school. In a short time, Haohao was on the blacklist for admission to this district. In desperation, Haohao had no choice but to go to a private primary school-Baihua Primary School. Baihua Primary School was rented by the principal at a low price in an old teaching building inside Xiaodi School. The principal and Hao Hao hit it off right away, and felt that he had the style of his childhood, so he readily accepted Hao Hao. \u3000\u3000 Haohao became Xiao Di's alumnus, but Xiao Di disdain to admit that he has a younger brother who goes to school in a dilapidated old building. Xiao Di always said that I am different from you, and I went to school in the new shiny golden building. Haohao didn't care about her, so he looked for her sister when it was time to look for her, which caused a lot of trouble to Xiao Di who was afraid of trouble and lazy. But once Haohao had difficulties, Xiao Di would still come forward. \u3000\u3000 There is a transfer student Xiao Xiaochao in Xiaodi\u2019s class. Xiaodi sees Xiaochao thin and thinks that Xiaochao\u2019s family is very poor. She brought a fried chicken drumstick to Xiao Xiaochao every day and told him that it was free! One day, Xiao Xiaochao did not come to class. Xiao Di was worried about whether Xiao Xiaochao was sick because of hunger, but suddenly heard the rumbling outside the classroom, and the classmates outside screamed. Xiao Di took a closer look and found that Xiao Xiaochao came to school in a helicopter! On the opposite side of Dad\u2019s \"Bombing Chicken\" shop, a new opponent called \"Battle Chicken\" came; Mom secretly rented her garage to someone else as a warehouse; Da Di\u2019s boyfriend Ma Linshu unexpectedly became popular, and Da Di\u2019s Happy and worried; Xiao Di, who has always been only interested in eating and sleeping, has recently suddenly become diligent and beautiful. It turns out that the most innocent feelings for Xiao Chao have sprouted in a small heart; and Hao Hao and Grandma are the oldest The little hearts are getting closer and closer, as close as grandchildren... \u3000\u3000 What other unexpected stories happened in the Chen family?

The two depended on the small cake shop opened in front of the house. They made delicious and cheap biscuits, which won everyone's praise. The money they could make was only enough for Xiao Song to study and maintain a basic life, mainly because many people lived after the war. They are very difficult. Although Song Xin's cakes are popular with everyone, they are very self-denying and low in price, so they don't make much money. In addition to class, Xiao Song has to help his aunt make cakes and watch the shop in the rest of the time. \u3000\u3000Because Xiao Song's parents have died since his young child, only his aunt Song Xin is dependent on him. So Song Xin is very strict with Xiao Song. In addition to asking Xiao Song to read a book, he also wants Song to inherit the true biography of his dead father and family. \u3000\u3000 The Song family was already well-known in the mainland before the war. The family inherited the Chinese \"etiquette\" festival and created many cake-making secrets with originality. A simple piece of cake embodies family affection, heart, friendship, and closeness. Although a piece of pie is an invaluable thing, if people keep the gift, the relationship between the person and the person, the relationship between family members, and the relationship between friends must be more intimate and harmonious. Because you personally deliver a delicious cake to your loved ones, the recipients will feel that they are valued and cared by relatives and friends. Therefore, the pie maker must not be sloppy with every piece of pie, and must show full sincerity. Xiao Song was educated in this way by his aunt since he was a child, so he would be rude to classmates, friends, and even seeing others passing by, disrespect of elders, arrogant, detrimental, self-interested, and irresponsible, he would stand up, if others do not listen to persuasion , He will try to let the person know his mistake, and finally apologize. But there are many people who are not polite and selfish, and they listen to less advice. When Xiao Song can't figure out a way, he will run to the attic of the cabin, where his aunt who made mistakes since childhood punished him to study. Xiao Song would eat a piece of cake made by his aunt with his father\u2019s secret recipe, open the classics left by his father, and return to the ancient times in meditation, where Xiao Song would respectfully ask his deceased elder Song Bing for advice.

When they encounter difficulties and injustices together, they will face them together and solve problems with mutual help. \u3000\u3000 In addition, Xiao Song\u2019s teacher, Mr. Situ, also taught Xiao Song a lot of useful knowledge and principles of life. Although Mr. Situ\u2019s school is arduously operated, it has helped many children to read and write and cultivate talents. On the contrary, the overlord general in town is a nasty guy. He relied on taking military power, and often together with his little wife, Xiaolian, oppressed the common people. Fortunately, the resourceful Xiao Song was able to suppress the general\u2019s arrogance, and sometimes even let the generals and his wife in public. Make a fool of yourself, very happy.

Influenced by the pilot's father, he is very talented in remote control helicopters. . Due to her mother's job transfer, Meng Fei returned to his hometown. It was a small town where remote control helicopters were popular. He met Yi Xuan, a girl who is a master of remote control helicopters. In order to find the mysterious person who taught him how to play remote control helicopters when he was a child, Meng Fei agreed to team up with Yi Xuan to compete, and under Yi Xuan's training, his skills continued to improve. Later, they helped Xiao Ming, a frail young man, overcome his timid weakness and let him join the team. The Yi Fei Soaring Team was established. \u3000\u3000 There are two other remote control helicopter masters in the small town: Gao Chong and Zhuo Yi. Although they are masters, the two of them hated helicopters because of the shadows when they were young, and used it to cause damage on the court, which made Yi Xuan very hated. Fan Xiaotian, a liar teenager, wished to join the team of the two on the condition of spying on the intelligence of the Lei Su Deng Yi Fei Soo team, but was ruthlessly used. The members of the Wing Fei Soaring Team disregarded the previous suspicions and agreed to join Fan Xiaotian after seeing that they had changed their past. Although Gao Chong and Zhuo Yi have been inseparable partners since childhood, Zhuo Yi's arrogant game style made Zhuo Yi increasingly dissatisfied. At the same time, he was also infected by the love of helicopters from the members of the Yi Fei Sky team, so they resolutely broke with Gao Chong. After some twists and turns, Zhuo Yi and Yi Xuan finally settled their suspicions and became their teammates. At this time, Meng Fei's father returned to China and continuously helped Meng Fei's people to improve their skills with completely new methods, but there were also ridiculous and absurdities, and many jokes were made. After \u3000\u3000 broke with Zhuo Yi, Gao Chong met a mysterious person. He was fired from the airport for teaching Meng Fei to play helicopters. After being fired, the mysterious man met his young father Meng Fei, and the two became very close friends. Later, because of differences in game tactics, he and Meng Fei's father became enemies and became sinister and vicious. After seeing Gao Chong's talent in remote control helicopters, he decided to accept him as an apprentice and teach him to use various despicable methods to control the remote control industry. \u3000\u3000 So the Wing Fei soaring team and Gao Chong, the mysterious man began to constantly compete. Everyone obtained an upgraded version of the helicopter through hard work and different methods, and they began to gain a new understanding through mutual exchanges. Gao Chong and Mysterious Man were also gradually moved by the sincerity of the members of the Yifei Sky Team and their persistent love for helicopters. Gao Chong is willing to become friends with everyone in Meng Fei. \u3000\u3000 At this time, the manager of the remote control field invited the current world champion to participate in a large competition he held. The champion once stole a new helicopter developed by Mysterious Man and Meng Fei's father and used it to dominate the remote control industry. The mysterious man participated in the competition for revenge. In order to prevent his revenge, Meng Fei's father also participated in the competition masked to protect Meng Fei from the world champion. In the game, the world champion revealed its sinister true colors, defeating opponents one by one with despicable methods, even the mysterious man is no exception. In the end, Meng Fei and his father worked together and finally outsmarted the world champion.
