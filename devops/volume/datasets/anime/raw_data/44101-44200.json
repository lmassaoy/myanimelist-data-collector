On the way, Li Shimin was attacked by a Luoyang killer bought by Yang Guang. During the crisis, he happened to meet Qin Qiong, who was escorting the prisoners. After Qin Qiong repelled Liao Wuji and rescued Li Shimin, he learned that the killer was sent by Yang Guang. He was afraid of trouble and left without saying goodbye. . In order to repay Qin Qiong\u2019s life-saving grace, Li Shimin erected a temple for Qin Qiong as a memorial. (A few years later, Qin Qiong knew how Li Shimin knew his favor, so he resolutely followed.) After Qin Qiong sent the prisoner to Luzhou, because of the theft of tolls and a serious illness, when he was forced to sell his yellow horse, he met Shan Xinxiong, a hero in the green forest. He has always respected Qin Qiong's personality and martial arts, so he gave a generous gift of silver. On the way home, Qin Qiong was guilty of believing that a shopkeeper was a ringing horse, and was convicted of beating the shopkeeper to death. He was sent to Yanshan by the local government. Later, because of Luo Cheng\u2019s father, Luo Yi, he went to Shandong Jiedu to use Tang Bi as a banner. official. Soon after Qin Qiong arrived in Shandong, Yang Chang murdered Emperor Wen of Sui to usurp the throne. When he forced Minister Wu Jianzhang to forge a will to inform the world, Jianzhang was killed, causing Jianzhang's son, Nanyang Prefect Wuzhi, to rise up against the Sui Dynasty. Yang Guang ordered Han Qinhu to ascend to the throne after an amnesty in Nanyang. After the severely sentenced Cheng Yaojin was rescued from prison, Shan Xiongxin saw that he was a hero, so he took him into a robbery no-profit business, but he had to rely on the mountain king Yang Lin\u2019s hundreds of thousands of taels of silver, so he burned and arrested him in public. Ticket. Unexpectedly, Shan Xiongxin and Cheng Yaojin were arrested in Huangtugang again, so Xu Maogong and other heroes returned to Shandong, rescued the two people, gathered in Wagangzhai, and supported Cheng Yaojin as the \"Hunting Demon King\", smashing the multiple conquests of the Sui army. . Yang Guang, the emperor, was going to Yangzhou for a cruise and ordered the canal to be dug. Corrupt officials took the opportunity to search the people's fat, harm the people, make the people unhappy, the world is chaotic, and the heroes are everywhere. At this time, Li Yuan, who had been hesitating, under Li Shimin's persuasion, also attacked Taiyuan, attacked Chang'an, and became the king of Tang. Cheng Yaojin of the Wagang Army felt that being an emperor was boring and gave the throne to Li Mi, a counselor. Li Mi set himself up as the king of the Western Wei Dynasty and led the troops to sweep the Sui Dynasty, and received a response from the world. Emperor Sui Yang, who had traveled to Yangzhou fortunately, was finally killed by his most trusted Yu Culture. Li Mi took the opportunity to take down Yangzhou. But he didn't want to make progress, began to corrupt and degenerate, but also jealous of his subordinates, and brutally killed his close comrades. But Li Shimin, who is ambitious and far-sighted, is thirst for talents and recruits talents. He very much appreciates the view of the eldest grandson girl who has become his wife: the battle to unify the world is also a battle for talents. Whoever has a group of outstanding talents can win the world by trusting and relying on these talents. As a result, the advisers and generals who had rebelled against Li Mi voted in Li Shimin's sect, and Li Mi, who had rebelled against his family, was finally defeated by the Chinese Iranian Wang Shichong. Under the command of Li Shimin, Xu Maogong, Qin Qiong, Yu Chigong, Cheng Yaojin, Luo Cheng and others led their troops to defeat the Eighteenth Route. In this war of unification, Li Shimin was helped by the eighteen stick monks of Shaolin Temple and killed Wang Shichong to perform a rather magical story. However, the talented Li Shimin has always been hated by Prince Li Jiancheng and Qi Wang Li Yuanji. After their conspiracy to murder Li Shimin was exposed, the unbearable Li Shimin finally launched the \"Xuanwumen Change\", except for Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji. Afterwards, Li Shimin was also supported by the officials to ascend the throne of God, for Tang Taizong.(translated from baidu baike)", "background": "No background information", "details": {"Japanese": "\u968b\u5510\u82f1\u96c4\u4f20", "Type": "TV", "Episodes": "52", "Status": "Finished Airing", "Aired": "Sep 1, 2002 to ?", "Broadcast": "Unknown", "Producers": ["add some"], "Licensors": ["None found"], "Studios": ["add some"], "Source": "Manga", "Genres": ["Adventure", "Historical"], "Duration": "22 min. per ep.", "Rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "Score": "N/A", "ScoredBy": "", "Ranked": "#0", "Popularity": "#0", "Members": "0", "Favorites": "0"}, "data_extraction": "2021-02-16 22:55:12"}, {"id": 44179, "title": "Qinhan Yingxiong Chuan", "photo": null, "links": {"episodes": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/44179/Qinhan_Yingxiong_Chuan/episode", "stats": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/44179/Qinhan_Yingxiong_Chuan/stats", "characters & staff": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/44179/Qinhan_Yingxiong_Chuan/characters"}, "synopsis": "After Qin destroyed the Six Kingdoms, Zhang Liang, who was born in the original Korean nobleman, was dissatisfied with the rule of the Qin Dynasty and planned to plan a \"beheading operation\" to assassinate Qin Shihuang.

Ximen geese walked away after Han Wangsun was named the king of Han by Xiang Yu and wanted to make her the princess. The appearance of Ximen Yan surprised and delighted Zhang Liang.
