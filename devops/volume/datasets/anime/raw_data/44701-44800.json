The film is actually somewhat suspenseful and very realistic at the same time. I am afraid that for some viewers, this film is very literary. Although it is interspersed with majestic virtual worlds and various entanglements in the virtual world from time to time, this film , The description of contemporary young people is fairly successful. This film pays great attention to the portrayal of characters, delicate performances, and emphasizes the concept of virtual actors. The era is moving more and more towards virtualization. Whether it is the booming development of the game industry or the virtual era that is constantly emphasized in major movies, it is slow Slowly emerges the concept that virtual actors will replace real actors? This will be a new movie model that may emerge. \"Avatar\" is doing a great job. With the advancement of technology, the cost will become smaller and smaller. It is naturally impossible for us to compare with any big movie that is really going to the theater. Just sneaked out a small step in this direction. Therefore, in this film, we focus on depicting people and depicting a vivid virtual actor. The story itself is not a shocking event that saves the world and fights the devil. It starts from our lives, from the most basic, and talks about our players. The story, this is the first time our crew has produced a film in the mode of a movie. The engineering files produced by this film are more than all 7 episodes of \"Warriors of the Alliance\". The film length has reached 30 minutes, and the screen is more than \"Warriors\". With a qualitative leap, the action design has completely opened the distance. The plot has been carefully designed. Maybe some viewers may not understand it, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Since the film runs only 30 minutes, we can\u2019t talk too much. Complete, but every shot, every line, every plot has been designed, and the audience may find the answer in the film, or find the answer in reality.

They gradually gathered uprising forces within the army, while waiting for the opportunity of the revolution... \u3000\u3000 In May, a mass movement took place in the neighboring province of Sichuan. The tense ruler hurriedly dispatched some new troops from Wuchang to suppress it. The military strength in Wuchang city declined, and the Revolutionary Party felt that the time for an uprising had arrived. However, the process of the uprising was full of twists and turns: When the leader of the Revolutionary Party deployed the uprising arrangement, the soldiers of the Nanhu Pao Camp in Chengnan accidentally leaked news of the uprising due to drinking and making trouble. The revolution failed for the first time; the Revolutionary Party manufactured explosives in the Hankou Concession. At the time, the operation error caused the bomb to explode, the list of revolutionary party members was searched, the leader of the revolutionary party was forced to flee the city, and the revolutionary plan failed for the second time; the revolutionary party decided to advance the uprising, but the ruler blocked the whole city and the news of the uprising was not available It was communicated to the soldiers in time, and the uprising plan failed for the third time; during this period, the ruler launched a hysterical counterattack, conducted a large-scale search of the city, and killed the backbone of the Revolutionary Party... \u3000\u3000 In the most critical time, the soldiers at the bottom were determined to save themselves. In the evening of October 10th, the uprising broke out with a gunshot from the soldiers of the uprising. Soldiers from all military camps heard the gunshots and all took part in the action. They aimed their artillery at the Governor's Mansion. After fierce fighting, the Qing army retreated steadily and high-ranking officials fled. In the early morning of the 11th, the entire Wuchang city was completely controlled by the Revolutionary Party. At dawn, the 18-star flag of the Revolutionary Party was planted on the tower of Wuchang. \u3000\u3000 On October 17, 1911, a ceremony to symbolize victory and a call for revolution to the whole country was held in Wuchang Yuemachang. People were very excited. This uprising and the ensuing national revolution put an end to China's monarchy for more than two thousand years.
