In the meantime, Zhuge Liang insisted on uniting Wu against Cao, and after seven captures of Meng Huo, he stabilized the rear. Six of the Qishan defeated Wei, but all ended in failure. Zhuge Liang also became sick from overwork and died of illness. After his death, Jiang Wei succeeded in his post, successively defeated the Central Plains nine times, and returned without success. The latter lord Liu Chan was faint and incompetent, the government was corrupt, and the power of the Shu Han was gradually weakening.
