They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \"Seven Deadly Sins,\" were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones. Based on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins.
