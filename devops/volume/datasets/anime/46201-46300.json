The meteorites that fell from the sky were obtained by Liu Bowen. These stones have incredible energy. Because they can produce greater energy and effect when placed together, Liu Bowen named them \"Zhu Pyxi\". Among them, there are nine largest fragments, which not only have unique functions, but also can distort and travel through time and space. Liu Bowen ordered the nine stones to be beaten to look like the head of a dragon, with the purpose of concealing the legend. After that, the nine leading figures also played a big role for Zhu Yuanzhang to stabilize the world. During the \"Battle of Jingnan\", Zhu Di stole nine dragon heads. When the situation was unfavorable, he used them to reverse the situation in one fell swoop, but these nine dragon heads also scattered into different time and space. In the Qing Dynasty more than a hundred years later, a Qing scientist named Ding Quanna discovered the value of dragon heads and the ability to travel through time and space, so he determined to find the whereabouts of dragon heads in all time and space. Until one day Ding Quanna discovered that one of the dragon heads might be in the hands of his descendants, and tried his best to come to the modern age alone. The protagonist of the story, Ding Dana, is a Beijing \"Ban'er Ye\" living in contemporary Beijing, who is also the tricycle driver of the traditional Beijing tourism project \"Hutong Tour\". Ding Dana had no father or mother since she was a child. She was brought up by the government and landlord Laizhixin (that is, the second uncle). Laizhixin is the descendant of the Sixth Division of Military Aircraft and Laizhi has been guarding the military aircraft for many years. The six big houses also support the descendants of the Ding family. Ding Dana's father and grandfather died together with the enemy in order to save the time and space from breaking down. They were also locked in time and space, and Dana would never be able to return to the time when his father was alive. Dana's father is also a leader. Since Ding Quanna found the clues of the dragon head, the Ding family seemed to be cursed and had a puzzled relationship with the dragon head and most of them had no good deaths, but only one of them was not affected. This person was Ding Quanna. In order to prevent his last descendant Ding Da from taking the old path of his parents, he has been trying to secretly protect and influence Dana. When Ding Quanna traveled through time and space to find Ding Dana for the first time, he was in a wilderness praying for God\u2019s blessings for his financial situation. Ding Quanna, who loved his son, asked Dana to buy all kinds of modern simple objects for him. Sent to the Qing Dynasty to be dedicated to the emperor in exchange for rewards. Ding Quanna also used these rewards to subsidize the \"Sixth Military Aircraft\" research institute he was looking for. Although Ding Quanna did not find the whereabouts of the dragon\u2019s head during this trip, he taught Dana how to use the dragon\u2019s head to travel through time and space and trained himself as a helper. Ding Quanna gave Ding Dana a piece called \"Laughing Phoenix\". \"Dana's leader, Ding Dana placed it on the tricycle of his Hutong tour. Coupled with the leg strength Dana has cultivated over the years, this tricycle has also become a weapon for traveling through time and space. However, at the same time that Dana\u2019s financial situation eased the ancestors and grandchildren just to establish trust, Ding Quanna\u2019s former manager of Qing Dynasty research institutions, Zhu Fuguo, appeared. Zhu Fufu and Ding Quanna studied the mystery of the dragon head together and knew the power of the dragon head. However, he was later imprisoned by the Qing court to Tian jail because he was found to be a descendant of Zhu Yuanzhang and had a tendency to rebel. Although his heart was dark but deep According to the mechanical principle, the wooden armored man made from the pyroxene fragments has amazing lethality. Zhu Fugu always wanted to use the power of the dragon head to control the entire time and space. In a sudden flood in Jiangxi, Emperor Qianlong remembered that when Zhu Fugu was an official, he was able to manage water well and asked Ding Quanna to go to the prison to recruit An Zhu Fugu again to serve the Qing court again. Who knew Ding Quanna and Ding Dana brought them Arriving in the prison, he found that Zhu Fugu had already escaped. Ding Quanna came back to the mansion in the middle of the night and encountered a mysterious wooden assassin pretending to be a big-na for assassination. After carefully examining the wooden armored man\u2019s pyroxene joints, Ding Quanna confirmed that this was Zhu Fugu\u2019s work. Once Zhu Fugu escaped The prison must be the first to capture the leader and mock the phoenix. By the time Quanna arrived in modern times, Zhu Fuguo\u2019s wooden armor men had already found Dana, and at the very moment, they all took out their hands to save the ancestors and grandchildren from the danger, but once Zhu Fugu escaped its danger and threat to the leader It is impossible to estimate that since then, in order to prevent the dragon from falling into the hands of Zhu Fuguo, the grandfather and grandson have launched a battle for the dragon across time and space. Yang Lucy is a friend who grew up with Ding Dana, and is also Ding Dana's love object. After graduating from the history department of university, Lucy has been helping in the watch shop of his uncle (the second uncle). By chance, Yang Lucy discovered the secret of Ding Dana. Lucy quickly understood with his sensitivity to history and time. With the important mission of the grandparents of the Ding family, the three of them embarked on a journey to find a protection leader. \"Time and Space Banye\" is a series of cartoons.
