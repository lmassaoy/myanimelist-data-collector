After multiple attempts to retrieve the cookie fail, Hamtarou suggests that he be lowered down into the vase, like a prize-catching crane machine. With this plan, Hamtarou is able to retrieve Bijou's biscuit. The vase wobbles and he begins to fall, but the dog wakes up and rescues the hamster by catching him with a pillow. With Hamtarou saved, Bijou hugs Hamtarou graciously and the episode ends as Hamtarou watches the dog slip away to go back to sleep.

Before she leaves for school, Natsumi tells Hamtarou she likes him while petting him. In response, without her understanding, Hamtarou confesses to Natsumi that he loves her romantically, but knows that Natsumi only loves him as a companion. She then has to leave for school and meets her classmate, Shirohara, to walk with him. Hamtarou wishes to become rivals with the schoolboy, who he knows Natsumi has a crush on. He spends the day venting and whining to Wanta about how Shirohara has beaten him for Natsumi's affection, and eventually tires himself out. At the end of the day, however, Natsumi tells Hamtarou that she loves him very much, which makes him very happy.

After the interview, they spend the day together. As they gradually become more comfortable with one another, Souichirou asks for her hand in marriage. Things quickly heat up between them, and the two wind up in bed together. However, when she removes his glasses, she discovers he is not Souichirou; he is actually one of her problem students, Souji Kuga! Souji's explanation is watertight: when he realized his brother was to be Nano's intended, Souji posed as him in order to be with her. And what's more, he is even confident that his family will approve of their marriage. However, an illicit relationship with a student is the last thing Nano wants.
